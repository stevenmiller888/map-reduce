Execution in computer and software engineering is the process by which a computer or a virtual machine performs the instructions of a computer program
The instructions in the program trigger sequences of simple actions on the executing machine
Those actions produce effects according to the semantics of the instructions in the program
Programs for a computer may execute in a batch process without human interaction
or a user may type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter
In this case the commands are simply programs whose execution is chained together
The term run is used almost synonymously
The context in which execution takes place is crucial
